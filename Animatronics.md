🤖 Animatronics Training Master Plan
====================================

Phase 1: Electronics & Microcontrollers
---------------------------------------

**Goal:** Master the "Nervous System" and power management.

-   **Days 1--3: The Basics**

    -   Learn digital vs. analog signals.

    -   **Key Skill:** Read a potentiometer value to control an LED's brightness.

-   **Days 4--7: Servo Anatomy**

    -   Understand PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) and how it sets motor angles.

    -   **Key Skill:** Sweep a servo from 0° to 180° smoothly.

-   **Days 8--10: External Power**

    -   Learn to use a Breadboard Power Supply.

    -   **Crucial Rule:** Never power motors directly from the Arduino 5V pin.

-   **Days 11--14: Input Control**

    -   Map joystick movement to servo movement.

Phase 2: Mechanical Design & CAD
--------------------------------

**Goal:** Transform motor rotation into lifelike character movement.

-   **Days 1--5: Simple Machines**

    -   Study 1-DOF vs. multi-axis movement.

    -   **Key Skill:** Build a "crank-rocker" mechanism out of cardboard or foam core.

-   **Days 6--10: Introduction to CAD**

    -   Learn "sketching" and "extruding" in **Fusion 360**.

    -   **Key Skill:** Design and 3D print (or build) a custom servo horn extension.

-   **Days 11--14: Hardware Literacy**

    -   Identify and use bearings, rod ends (Heim joints), and clevises.

* * * * *

Phase 3: Software & Animation Logic
-----------------------------------

**Goal:** Move from "robotic" jitter to fluid, organic motion.

-   **Days 1--4: Non-Blocking Code**

    -   Replace `delay()` with `millis()`.

    -   **Key Skill:** Program a "Blink" that happens while a "Head Turn" is already in motion.

-   **Days 5--8: The Animation Pipeline**

    -   Install **Bottango** (Animatronic Control Software).

    -   **Key Skill:** Keyframe a 10-second sequence and play it back on your hardware.

-   **Days 9--14: Randomized Idle**

    -   Write a script for "Autonomous Life"---random eye darts and subtle swaying.

* * * * *

Phase 4: Aesthetics & Skinning
------------------------------

**Goal:** The "Art" of the Animatronic.

-   **Days 1--5: Anatomy & Sculpting**

    -   Study facial muscle groups.

    -   **Key Skill:** Sculpt a character face over a 3D-printed "underskull."

-   **Days 6--10: Mold Making**

    -   Learn two-part stone or fiberglass molding techniques.

-   **Days 11--14: Casting Skin**

    -   Work with **Dragon Skin silicone**.

    -   **Key Skill:** Attach the silicone skin to your mechanical "points of contact."
