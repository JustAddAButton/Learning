Meren of Clan Nel Toth: The Queen of Reiteration
------------------------------------------------

**Strategy:** High-Power Aristocrats / Combo-Toolbox

**Power Level:** 8/10 (Optimized)

This deck is a classic "Graveyard Toolbox" strategy. Your goal is to spend the early game generating **Experience Counters** by sacrificing small, high-value creatures. In the mid-to-late game, Meren turns your graveyard into a second hand, allowing you to cheat massive threats into play every single turn. If the "fair" value game doesn't work, the deck features several compact infinite combos to end the game on the spot.

The Core Gameplay
--------------------

### 1\. The Early Game: Building the Engine

Your priority is to get Meren on the board and start "cycling" your creatures.

-   **Key Openers:** *Sakura-Tribe Elder* is your best friend. It ramps you, puts itself in the grave, and gives Meren an Experience Counter.

-   **The "Spore Frog" Lock:** Against aggressive decks, reanimating *Spore Frog* every turn creates a "Fog" loop that prevents opponents from ever hitting you with combat damage.

### 2\. The Mid Game: Controlled Attrition

Use "Edict" creatures (*Plaguecrafter*, *Fleshbag Marauder*) to keep the board clear. Because Meren brings them back, you can force opponents to sacrifice their best creatures every turn for $0$ mana.

-   **Draw:** Use *Skullclamp* and *Grim Haruspex* to ensure that every death replaces itself with more resources.

### 3\. The End Game: The "Big Mac" Play

Once you hit 6+ Experience Counters, you are looking for **Protean Hulk** or **Razaketh, the Foulblooded**. These cards allow you to tutor your win conditions directly to the field.

Infinite Combos (The Finishers)
----------------------------------

### 1\. The "Nooz" Combo (Fastest Win)

**Requires:** *Necrotic Ooze* on the battlefield; *Phyrexian Devourer* and *Walking Ballista* in the graveyard.

1.  *Necrotic Ooze* gains all activated abilities of creatures in your graveyard.

2.  Use the *Phyrexian Devourer* ability: Exile the top card of your library to put $+1/+1$ counters on the Ooze equal to the card's CMC.

3.  Use the *Walking Ballista* ability: Remove a $+1/+1$ counter from the Ooze to deal 1 damage to any target.

4.  **Result:** Infinite damage to the entire table (until your library is empty).

### 2\. Mike and Trike (Classic)

**Requires:** *Mikaeus, the Unhallowed* and *Triskelion* on the battlefield.

1.  Remove two $+1/+1$ counters from *Triskelion* to deal 2 damage to an opponent.

2.  Remove the last counter to deal 1 damage to *Triskelion* itself, killing it.

3.  Because of Mikaeus, *Triskelion* has **Undying**. It returns to the battlefield with a $+1/+1$ counter.

4.  **Result:** Repeat for infinite damage.

    *Note: This also works with **Walking Ballista** IF you have a sacrifice outlet like **Viscera Seer** to kill the Ballista while its Undying trigger is live.*

### 3\. The Protean Hulk "Pile"

If **Protean Hulk** dies, you can search for a combination of creatures with total CMC 6 or less.

-   **The Value Pile:** Fetch *Viscera Seer* + *Blood Artist* + *Haywire Mite* + *Sakura-Tribe Elder*.

-   **The Combo Setup:** Fetch *Viscera Seer* + *Walking Ballista* (0 CMC) + *Mikaeus, the Unhallowed* (This requires a reanimation spell or specialized sequencing, as Mike is CMC 6).

Pilot Tips
-------------

-   **Mindslicer is your "Reset" Button:** If you are ahead on board and have Meren out, sacrifice *Mindslicer*. It empties everyone's hands. Since you play from your graveyard and they don't, you essentially lock the table out of the game.

-   **Experience is Permanent:** Even if Meren is killed and recast, you keep your Experience Counters. Don't be afraid to let her die if it means saving a more important combo piece.

-   **Stacking Triggers:** At the beginning of your end step, you can stack the Meren trigger and other "end of turn" effects. Always resolve your sacrifice triggers first to maximize your count before Meren checks it.
